# Storybook Development Guide

## Introduction

This guide will help you understand how to use Storybook in our project for component development and documentation.

## Getting Started

1. Start the Storybook development server:

```bash
bun run storybook
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:

```bash
http://localhost:6006
```

Note: for installing the storybook, you have to path the `payload-admin-bar` to the `package.json` file.

```bash
"payload-admin-bar": "file:./patch/payload-admin-bar-1.0.6.tgz",
```
